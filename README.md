# not well written ncurses-game (with some bugs)

In this game, you need to prevent the 
assassination of the “president”. You can navigate the map using the arrows on your 
keyboard. To prevent murder, you must “sacrifice yourself” and stop the bullet with your 
“body”(body is player symbol «<»). If you move, the bullet is accelerating. If the bullet hits its 
target (the president), you lose.
